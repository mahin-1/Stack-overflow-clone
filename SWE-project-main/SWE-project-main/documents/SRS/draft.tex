\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
This product intends to be a social media platform where users can create communities of their choice with different visibilities and induldge in communities of similar interests. Users can also interact with other users through direct messaging.

Inorder to prevent malicious users, the platform also employs a moderation system where users can report posts and comments and moderators can moderate posts and comments in their communities.

The product also intends to employ a recommender system to recommend communities and create a user-specific feed for each user.

The product is a web application and hence is intended to be independent of any underlying operating system.
