\section{Overview}
The purpose of this software application is to provide a platform where users can create communities of their choice and induldge in communities of similar interests.This product intends to be a social media platform where users can create communities of their choice with different visibilities and induldge in communities of similar interests. Users can also interact with other users through direct messaging.\\
Inorder to prevent malicious users, the platform also employs a moderation system where users can report posts and comments and moderators can moderate posts and comments in their communities.
The product also intends to employ a recommender system to recommend communities and create a user-specific feed for each user.

The product is a web application and hence is intended to be independent of any underlying operating system.
    
\subsection{System Overview:}
 The principal actors in the system are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Guest Users: Users which have not created an account on the platform.
    \item Registered Users: Users which have created an account on the platform.
    \item Community Admins: Users which have created a community on the platform.
    \item Community Moderators: Users which have been appointed as moderators in a community.
    \item Superuser: Users which have the highest privileges on the platform.
    \item System: The system is also an actor in the system.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{System Context:}

\subsection{Scope of this Document:}
In this document we describe architecture for our software.

\section{ Architecture Design}

\subsection{Architecture 1: The Repository Model}

\begin{itemize}
    \item This architecture revolves around the data repository, which contains communities data, user data, conversation data, roles data for communities, posts/comments data for communities and authorization data
    \item All other components are connected to data repository through different connectors
\end{itemize}
