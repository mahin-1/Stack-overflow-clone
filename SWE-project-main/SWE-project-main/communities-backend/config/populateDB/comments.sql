You can then say that a triangle with vertices A, B, C is simply the shape consisting of the shortest paths between these vertices, and the angle that two paths form when they meet is, very roughly, what this angle would look like in a plane (the one you are used to) if you zoom in enough at the intersection such that the paths look straight.\n\nNow that we have set the above definitions, you can see that for what we named triangle and angle, you can find a triangle with 3 right angles on a sphere.','154','923','');

Pack a backpack with the basic essentials (food, water, jacket) and head out. \n\nThen expand to other areas / trails. Walk farther or steeper trails. Get out in a variety of conditions - warm, cold, rain, dry, whatever. \n\nOnce you are more comfortable with day hiking basics (navigation, fitness, packing, weather, etc.) - then you can plan your first overnight adventure. Ideally on a trail that you''ve already day hiked. You can scope out a tent site during a day hike - then return with your overnight kit to camp out. \n\nA single overnight can be relatively easy. Pick a day with good weather (no rain, comfortable temps). Walk less than 5 miles from the trailhead. Setup shop, eat food, sleep, pack up, walk back. Take notes of what went well and what needs improvement. \n\nThen expand to harder trails and longer trips. At this point - the world is your oyster. \n\n\n\nA few things to work out.... \n\nYou''ll need gear to make this happen. Day hiking stuff can be very simple - a school type backpack and water bottle. You can get fancy with a ultralight first aid kit, headlamp, swiss army knife, and lots of ''hiking'' snacks. Overnight kit can get pretty involved - do some real research before jumping in. Your budget will really dictate how easy this gear-up phase goes. \n\nPermits are also a necessary evil. Different parks/trails will have different requirements. Some are totally open to anyone anytime. Others will be very restrictive and require lotteries and 360 day advance planning. Do your research and plan ahead accordingly.   \n\n  \nMy #1 advice is to get outside and go! Experience is the best teacher. You can read online in between your practice hikes.
