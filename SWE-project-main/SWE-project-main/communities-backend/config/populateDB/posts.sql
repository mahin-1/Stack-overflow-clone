I never once tried to act on these fantasies or anything like that however it still really bothers me, because I feel really alone in this issue, nobody seems to talk about it.

There are so many changes that I am looking forward to; even without the DLC, the base game update will be impressive, particularly to the Empire.\n\nI still have concerns with mid to late game mechanics, however, and frankly some of the new changes may just add on top of it.  Since release, most of the game can feel like early to mid game is fun, and then mid to late game there are no strategic threats because you as the player have built up a formidable empire (no pun intended- can happen to any faction), while the AI in most cases is struggling mid to late game.  \n\nI say all this because I haven''t really seen any indication that mid to late game campaign AI has been addressed.  As great as TOD may be, if the fundamental campaign AI isn''t addressed, then the game is still going to be over by mid campaign because there''s nothing to do.  Some specific examples of issues:\n\n\- AI factions that sue for peace (sometimes this may just be because the AI recognizes your factions power and is set to request peace; a REAL problem when playing as Cathay)\n\n\- Autoresolve still heavily favors the player; in some cases, you can easily load up on cheap units and steam roll very early on (\*cough Cathay cough cough\*) \n\n\- Confederation.  Certain factions can confederate too easily and too early on, allowing a steamroll effect  \n\n\nI''m REALLY REALLY HOPING that CA is taking a look at the mid to late game mechanics!!  It sucks getting to that point where there''s nobody left to fight or your enemies are just suing for peace!  ',2172,6,'text');

I looked around as I was able to see again, and noticed some people were laughing at me. All of them shifted away their looks except for a guy, he kept looking at me with a smug smirky face. Maybe all of them thought I was faking it? I don''t know.\n\nNow I know fainting is not the end of the world, but if someone was scared of it, or was scared very much by something else, I''m sure √ç wouldn''t tell them something like what they told me.

I wanted to get second opinions before I assess what to do next.\n\n*Context*: I recently had to leave a friend group because I was involved in some drama with two other people in it. My best friend stayed in the group and invited me to hang out with them one day because the people i was upset with were not gonna be there. Me leaving the friend group was just fresh (1 month ago) so I overthink about it a lot and my best friend knows this. \n\nI just found his response dismissive and hurtful at the time and decided to block him in the spur of the moment. Now we are not speaking and I am sad.

They were like brothers to me. We had group chats where we used to text daily, send memes etc. But then I realised, every time we would hang out, we would spend some money, mostly went somewhere to eat or something. Now I used to enjoy it until I realised this is just wasting money. Now they come from better financial backgrounds ig, so for them spending daily was not a problem, but I felt it too much once it started happening almost every day or alternate days.\n\n \nSo I tried not to hang out frequently. So maybe I started going once in 3 days or something like that. But then after sometime I realised they had started taking me for granted, and never cared about asking me out, which is kinda fair because I usually said no because I didn''t wanna spend money, but was embarrassed to tell them the reason, so I''d make some random reason. Our group chat was kind of becoming dead. They would rarely send something there.\n\nThen covid happened, all of us were in our homes. We used to play games together, have some group calls. And then lockdown started slowly opening up. Now covid was not over, but the restrictions were slowly started to lift. So I didn''t wanna take a risk of getting positive. We had one of our relatives tested positive for covid, he was serious ,and he lost hell lot of money in the treatment, thanks to God he survived. So now in my mind, i didn''t wanna be the reason to cost a lot of money to my family. So I even avoided that to not to go out during covid. But they did. They use to go out regularly. And some of them actually got positive and eventually got cured.\n\nBut then after covid, when I started to hang out with them again, i realised they actually had another group which I was not a part of. I realised this because they started talking about the meme someone had shared in the group, I was wondering when, then one friend also said that they other guy probably sends every meme he sees on Instagram. That is when It hit me. They made another group, excluding one or two people from our original group, and apparently named it "4 of us" (saw this when they showed me the meme they were talking about), now I am not sure that actually how many people were in it. But I was really hurt by this.\n\nI feel that is when we just fell apart. Now I am someone who befriends someone only if we meet a lot of times, because until then I don''t feel comfortable to talk freely to someone. So I college i had a few friends. But now they have their own school friends, and some other friends. So for me, they are like at the top priority in terms of friends, and for them am just another guy.\n\nOfcourse I am the reason this all has happened. I have brought this up on me. But now I don''t know what to do, whom to talk to. How to get great friends. I''m 21 and can''t call someone a best friend  anymore. So every new friend I try to make, they just become my best friend from my side, so I share everything with, but ofcourse they''ve got different priorities, so I eventually stop too.\n\nNow I just feel very nervous to talk to people. I get anxious and feel I just can''t get any friends. \n\nNo Idea what to do now',853,10,'text');

As a habitual toker that abused weed for about 15 years i just quit at the beginning of march. I threw away paraphernilia and deleted contacts. Everything in my life has gotten better. MUCH better.\n\nI''m just writing this post for anyone who might need the extra nudge. Take back control of your life if you abuse weed. For me, i''ve tried cutting back MANY times. But i could never *not* abuse it. I might slow down for a week max, but after that i''m back to abusive use. If you''re like me, and not everyone is, just throw your pipes and bongs and lighters away, delete contacts in which you can buy. Lucky for me i don''t have stoner friends anymore. If your friends are stoners, i''m not sure but maybe just let them know that you''re quitting, and keep your distance. \n\nI''ve struggled making friends all my life. But since quitting weed, i''ve gained so much confience and in this month alone have developed many relationships, just because i have more initiative to do so. If you''re using weed as a crutch to make you happy when you''re not, then you are greatly handicapping your ability to meet new people, and trust me when i say it''s so much better to be social. \n\nBefore, when smoking regularly, i''d have spurts of social perkiness, but it was always a chore. And i''d always say weird things or have strange ass thoughts. ITS THE WEED. \n\nAnother thing that has changed, VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, is my ability to play music. I''ve been playing guitar for longer than i''ve been smoking, and i''ve been training myself to sing for maybe 10 years. I record mysel a lot and use my recordings to teach myself what to do. Oh my god people. My recordings have gotten soooo much better in just this month. It''s crazy. \n\nI''ve loved weed for a long time, and i hope this isn''t coming off as preachy or braggy, but i just had a very hard time letting it go.

Can you guys give me some advice regarding what I said to him?','Before I share the message, let me offer some context. This guy is a really talented guitar player who won two separate 30 Seconds to Shred contests at Welcome to Rockville in 2018 and 2019. He‚Äôs hung out with members from different big name Rock and Metal bands and he was featured in Jared Dines‚Äô 5th Biggest Shred Collab video. The first time I talked to him was a couple years ago and we talked about the possibility of making music together and he was interested in doing so.\n\nThe only problem is that he would only ever respond to half of my messages. He said the reason for it is because he has a hard time getting back to everybody because of how busy he is.\n\nAt one point, it got to a point where he blocked me on Instagram for 2 months and then he unblocked me after those 2 months were over. Sometime after he unblocked me, we met each other irl for the first time at Welcome to Rockville in 2022, and he seemed happy to meet me.\n\nAfter that, he would pretty much be dead silent whenever I would send him messages. He pretty much ghosted me to the T, and I never understood why because he gave off the impression that he was cool with me when we first met each other irl. He also gave me that impression when I ran into him at an Alter Bridge concert last year and Welcome to Rockville 2023.\n\nAt one point, he sent me a lengthy message on Facebook Messenger saying something along the lines of ‚Äúit seems like you‚Äôve been trying to turn what was once enthusiastic support for my guitar playing into something different and it‚Äôs making me uncomfortable. Up until now, I‚Äôve tried to be polite and hope that maybe you‚Äôd get the hint, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be working. I need to be more direct with you. Please stop reaching out to me and please stop trying to find ways for us to get together. Again, I appreciate the support you‚Äôve given me as a guitar player over the years, but there is not and cannot be a relationship between us beyond that. Thank you.‚Äù\n\nWhen he sent me that message, I was gutted. It broke my heart and it made me cry. After that, I sent a follow up message apologizing to him for being clingy, which was the last message that I sent to him that he read.\n\nA few months later, I sent him the following message, and this is the message that I was talking about in the title of this post. The message is as follows:\n\n‚ÄúHey, so assuming that you never read this message, this is something that I wanna tell you in person if we ever run into each other at like a concert or something. I know you said you don‚Äôt want me to contact you (and I won‚Äôt, if that‚Äôs still what you want), but I really need to get this off my chest in order to feel a true sense of closure.\n\n‚ÄúSo the main reason I wanted to make music and start a band with you isn‚Äôt just because I think you‚Äôre a talented guitar player. It‚Äôs mainly because of the music industry connections that you have. You‚Äôre always hanging out with people from bands like Sevendust, Tremonti, Bad Wolves, Periphery, Through Fire, 5FDP (namely Chris Kael), etc., and I figured maybe I could use those connections to try to find ways to be successful in the industry. Like, maybe if I got to know the members of those bands like you did, I figured I could use that to find ways to make my music more successful than I would if I just did it the regular way like everybody else. Not only that, but maybe I could tour with those bands and other big-name bands and find success through that.\n\n‚ÄúOn top of that, you have the potential to either start your own band or join a big-name band and get success from doing either of those things. I was hoping I could ride off of whatever success you achieve from doing the former. I mean, fuck, you‚Äôve won multiple guitar contests and you were featured in a Jared Dines video. If that doesn‚Äôt scream that you‚Äôll be successful in the future, then idk what does.\n\n‚ÄúI guess it all just comes down to the fact that you‚Äôve always been lucky in your life, and I haven‚Äôt had much luck in my life (if any at all), so I was hoping I could share it with you. But now that I fucked that up and you don‚Äôt wanna be friends with me, it seems like I‚Äôll just have to settle for finding success the regular way, just like everybody else.\n\n‚ÄúRegardless of how things turn out, I‚Äôll still support you in whatever musical endeavors you end up doing, and I hope you have a great, successful life (one that I may never have, at the rate things have gone for me for the past 10+ years) and I wish you the best of luck. ü§òüèº‚Äù\n\nNow, I‚Äôm hoping to get your guys advice on whether or not I was right to send him this message and if there‚Äôs anything about the message that should‚Äôve changed before sending it to him.',2712,10,'text');

How would you troubleshoot this if it were you?','Hey all. \n\nAfter working many years on helpdesk, 5 months back I became the sole IT guy at a meat processing facility. Everything has been great except for this issue that I am having with a label printer.  Just to provide a little bit of context my company runs some pretty complicated interal erp software (which reminds of a ms dos program) which is in charge of all our internal products,payments , literally everything that you can imagine this program handles it. This program has a sql server database that runs on SERVER A. This program is then shared out by means of remote apps through a rds server called SERVER B. The program lives on SERVER B.  There is a thin client on each of our production lines which is just rdped into SERVER B running the erp program. \n\n\n\nNow here is the problem. \n\nPicture a box on a conveyor belt. This box goes under a scanner which identiefies which product it is. After being identified, it then hits our database to get more product information(weight,name etc).After all of this it finally prints a label to be put on the box. There is a mechanical arm which slaps the label on. Intermintenly , the label prints late which throws off the whole system since the boxes are on a conveyor belt. \n\nWe run fiber throughout our entire plant and the 2 servers mentioned are vms in a rack in one location. The terminal station along with the printer are on a different floor. The connection between the rds server and the sql server is spotless. Consistent <1ms . The connection between the rds server and the printer once again is under 1ms. All servers run win server 2022 and are up to date. Drivers up to date as well. Everything from a software side looks solid which makes me believe it is a networking issue. However, a week ago I connected the printer to a apc ups and the problem seemed to go away. We swapped out the power strip 2 weeks ago and everything was fine till this morning. However, once I swapped the battery again today it went away. \n\nThe apc shows a "Building wiring fault" in multiple locations of the floor. I brought this up to management and they are adament that this is not an electrical problem. I have done all I could for many weeks trying to figure this out and I get no help from the mechanics who I have asked many times to come and check out the electricity in the room.

I am a Sys Admin for a healthcare facility with a full Meraki wireless/switch infrastructure (Cisco ASA firewall. Yes I know, old school). They have a flat topology for all of their wired ethernet connections. They then have a dedicated VLAN for guest wireless (internet only) as well as a few others for VOIP, etc.\n\nThey have discussed wanting to add port security for their wired connections (either 802.1x or AD MAC filtering for managed PC''s). The tricky part here, is that they have dozens of Smart TV''s in rooms that are wired in because they are in areas with poor wireless coverage. They want to keep these TV''s wired in, without easily being able to identify which switch ports they are plugged into, while implementing port security for PC''s only. The intended end result would be that when an authorized PC plugs in, they are placed on the internal network, and when a non-company device (such as a smart TV) plugs in, it gets joined to a guest VLAN with internet-only access.\n\nI''ve found several solutions involving the use of splash screen redirection when a PC fails to present a certificate, but that doesn''t work for something like a Smart TV (to my knowledge). What options do I have that don''t involve going around to each TV and allowing the MAC address on the backend (assuming there are other options)? If that''s what it takes, that''s fine, just want to make sure there isn''t an easier way.\n\n  \nThanks!',125,12,'text');

Vidare s√• finns det √§ven redan viss lagstiftning p√• plats som m√∂jligg√∂r ett f√∂r√§ldraansvar, exempelvis vad g√§ller skadest√•nd. \n\nDet finns sj√§lvklart fall d√§r f√∂r√§ldrarna gjort det de kunnat f√∂r att f√∂rhindra barnets agerande men att det inte varit tillr√§ckligt, en helt√§ckande best√§mmelse om f√∂r√§ldra-ansvar hade s√•ledes varit allt annat √§n √∂nskv√§rd. Att dock inf√∂ra n√•gon form av best√§mmelse som tar sikte p√• att f√∂r√§ldrarna, i form av v√•rdnadshavare i enlighet med f√∂r√§ldrabalken, faktiskt har ett ansvar f√∂r barnets agerande och att f√∂r√§ldrarna skulle kunna d√∂mas till straffr√§ttsligt ansvar i de fall som de allvarligt brustit i sitt agerande som v√•rdnadshavare hade potentiellt kunnat medf√∂ra ett √∂kat ansvarstagande inom familjerelationerna. \n\nFr√•gan √§r s√•klart mer komplex √§n detta, som n√§mnt s√• finns det dock redan exempel p√• s√•dan ansvarsreglering inom skadest√•ndsr√§tten (f√∂r intresserade √§r det 3 kap. 5 ¬ß Skadest√•ndslagen som tar sikte p√• detta). Straffr√§tten fordrar visserligen mer omfattande avv√§gningar men mig veterligen s√• borde en s√•dan reglering √§ven vara m√∂jlig inom det omr√•det.\n\nTLDR: Finns redan lagstiftning om f√∂r√§ldrars ansvar f√∂r sina barns agerande vad g√§ller skadest√•ndsskyldighet, en liknande lagstiftning inom straffr√§tten skulle potentiellt medf√∂ra ett √∂kat ansvarstagande fr√•n v√•rdnadshavares sida.',2076,13,'text');

Should those conditions not be met and his Divine Core were to remain in a good enough condition he is even able to survive complete dismemberment or beheading. ‚ÄúHe is especially vulnerable to a certain immortal killing blade‚Äù\n\n\n**Noble Phantasms**\n\nPandemonium Gorgona \nType: Anti-self\nRank: A\nMaximum target: 1\n\nA transformation-type Noble Phantasm, by employing his Self Modification skill and Divine Core to its maximum Chrysaor transforms into his ideal, or perhaps true appearance. \n\nHuge wings sprawn from his back; Golden horns, bull-like in shape but formed like antlers grow from his head; his body grows to a gigantic height, fangs and claws become apparent, shining scales can be seen all over his body, his hair grows larger and like his mother‚Äôs turns into snake-like creatures and lastly, his Mystic Eyes inherited from the former are unsealed.\n\nOnce its true name is released Chrysaor‚Äôs saint graph becomes comparable to a Full fledged Divine Spirit, his strength and mana far surpassing the boundaries of heroic spirits. In this form the amount of destruction he could cause surpasses all monsters of the greek world save Typhon, but Chrysaor would never allow destruction without a target to be caused with his power and would only allow himself to use this Noble Phantasm in a last case scenario or to destroy someone who really stirs up his hate.\n\n\nThe√Øk√≥s Khrysaor \nType: Anti-army\nRank: A+\n\nThe Golden Sword Chrysaor was born wielding. Its true nature is that of the divinity of both his aunts devoured by Gorgon and the lost divinity of his mother being given new form  with Chrysaor inside the womb, as such it can be said the sword is part of his very being. \n\nWhen it''s true name is released a mighty Golden Slash composed of pure divine energy from the age of gods is unleashed.\n\nWhile it''s true name is not released Chrysaor can turn the Sword into part of his body in the form of tusks or horns, which comes in handy when he takes a more beast-like appearance.\n\n\n**Character**\n\nThe legendary son of the Sea god Poseidon and the former goddess Medusa. \nHad he been born before his mother''s transformation into the monster Gorgon, Chrysaor would naturally be born as a regular Divine Spirit, however due to her circumstances Medusa/Gorgon made the instinctively choice of holding him in a form of egg/womb within herself. Because of that, while in the womb Chrysaor‚Äôs nature changed to that of being simultaneously a monster and a god.\n\nIt would not be until the hero Perseus beheaded Gorgon that Chrysaor was truly born as already an adult carrying a golden sword and accompanied by Pegasus. Some variations of the legend claim he came out as a winged boar with golden tusks instead.\n\nSomewhen later in life Chrysaor would become the king of Iberia and marry the Oceanid Callirhoe, fathering with her the Three-bodied Geryon and the she-monster Echidna. However what happened between his birth and the events in his later life is unknown and he himself refuses to talk about it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not important‚Äù.\n\n\n**Appearance** \n\nA Young Man is his apparent early-twenties with a somewhat athletic build, long Violet hair and gentle expression.\n\n\n**Personality**\n\nA Quick to love and be loved person. Though Chrysaor appears always calm and dignified as a king, he is quite the energetic person once he is close enough to someone, acting almost like a child if the situation permits it or he sees something that takes his interest. He has a gentle way of speaking, always showing concern for people around him and trying to understand their situation. He loves people and nature but is faced with sadness and anger when witnessing prejudice against his kind.\nThe thing he most values is his family and the very concept of a happy family, so if anyone were to ever insult or injure any of his family members he would be very likely to attack them without a second thought.\n\nHe has a complicated relation to heroes and gods. Though he understands when heroes came into conflict with monsters in order to save someone he can''t help but feel sad about it, however, the same can not be said for people that hurt his children or hunt monsters for nothing but the glory of doing so. To him those people are trash that should be decimated on sight.\nAs to the gods of his land he feels disconnected to most of them due to their different natures and can''t seem to stand how they constantly seem to play with mortal lives and barely care for their own children.\n\nThe reason Chrysaor never came to hate Perseus is that the whole time he was in the womb he could feel all the emotions going through his mother. While sharing all of her sorrow and seeing how she lost more and more of herself all he could do for a long time was hope and pray that someday someone would come to save her, and in the end, that salvation came in the form of a young hero seeking to save his own mother.\n\n \n**Reactions/ Relationships/ Dialogue examples** \n\n\n**Perseus**: ‚ÄúIf I have a grudge against Perseus? No, not at all. I know he only wanted to save his own family, also in some ways I''m grateful to him, I''m sure mother would feel the same‚Ä¶ I think‚Äù\n\n**Perseus (prototype)**: ‚ÄúPerseus, I know not what happened so that your eyes would become so dark.

But at least in this life, I hope those two can become friends.‚Äù\n \n**Cadmus**: ‚ÄúHey Cadmus, long time no see! Is that your wife right there? Man you‚Äôre lucky. I wish my Callirhoe could be summoned with me.‚Äù\n\n**Enkidu**: Sees him as a Kindred Spirit and a friend found in this new life, but the blonde king that accompanies him is really troublesome.\n\n**Any of the children of Kerana and Tau**: ‚ÄúI''d never expected to meet other beings like me, especially from a land so far away and after so much time‚Äù\n\n**Angrboda**: ‚ÄúSo that''s Angrboda‚Ä¶ I''m sure we can relate to each other.‚Äù \n\n**Heracles**: ‚ÄúMaster, let It be warned, should he ever be summoned as anything other than a mindless Berserker I''ll kill him on the spot, the amount of blood left in his wake is unforgivable, not only of all those people and monsters but he dared to kill my son and humiliate my grandchildren. He will pay.‚Äù\n\n**Orpheus**: ‚ÄúI really want to hear him play but for some reason I keep falling asleep every time! Please help me master!‚Äù\n\n**Britomart I**: ‚ÄúThat woman keeps looking at me for some reason. Do we know each other from somewhere? ‚ÄúShe is just looking at my sword‚Äù? That‚Äôs the same thing.‚Äù\n\n**Kijyo Koyo**: Has the highest respect for her as someone who would turn into a monster to protect her own child.\n\n**Oni kind**: ‚ÄúI feel a sort of kinship with them but to be honest, sometimes I really don‚Äôt understand their antics‚Äù\n\n**Dragon kind**: Perhaps due to his relation with Typhon doesn''t seem to differentiate them as a different species.\n\n**Typhon**: "COME BACK HERE YOU IDIOT SON-IN-LAW!!

INSERT INTO posts(title,content,creator_id,community_id,post_type) VALUES ('Astolfo Related Fiction Ideas (Revised)','Ah hello! I once was obsessed with our best boy Astolfo (still sort of am), and had this exciting story idea related to him, but I posted it a year ago in a subreddit which had the scummy unwritten rule to not post specifically about Astolfo, even if everything else about it is rule abiding! Now let''s start with saying I don''t expect anyone to do anything with my ideas, but if they do unofficially as a fan thing, or officially (while unlikely) I''d be pretty happy to see it! I probably won''t write something myself at this rate, but if I do I would be happy to share when I do. So without further ado:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Astolfo is summoned into a holy grail war by a kid claiming to be his son\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn general Fate stuff is a fantasy/mage world right? Forgive me if I''m shortsighted there. Is it entirely impossible that behind the legend of the Paladins of Charlemagne the reality was Astolfo did live, and did have a kid or two? And what if that kid was in stasis for centuries until recently in the modern day where he/she then grows up adopted by a mage family, unloved, and so lonely getting through the mage academy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe/she one way, or another came to figure out their father was Astolfo the Paladin of Charlemagne of long ago. The Holy Grail War is coming up, and he/she takes the plunge summoning an aspect (class) of his father using their blood as a catalyst. Oh the joy of the kid finally having a loving father (yet motherly) figure, and the surprise of Astolfo to see his child has lived to this time. Astolfo doing his characteristic lecturing of how dangerous this all is (like he did with Sieg in Apocrypha). Of course despite that Astolfo would hug, pat, and say the most awkward yet caring things for the son/daughter he never knew he had, or was still around. They would fight the Holy Grail War as a family!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith all of this you have the opportunity to get more in depth on perhaps the Saber aspect of Astolfo. You''d also get to see something close to a younger Astolfo from the kid. The kid''s the master of their summoned father (reminds me of Fate/Stay Night with how Rin summoned someone who hasn''t made their legend yet, and was currently living). The tension, other than the holy grail war they''re participating in, would come from the aspect of a servant not being the full person they reflect, and in turn would give Astolfo''s child their wish in the end. That he/she''s dad become full, and that they can be happy together forever! It doesn''t need to have that happy ending however as much as I like the idea (I would love to see a "complete" Astolfo though!).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAstolfo as a father! A cute trap dad! I''d love to see, or read it, and if I can''t I may write it. :>\n\nAnd thank you so much for reading my thoughts, fellows.',625,14,'text');

Ill lay out the situation. sunday the 7th I broke up with my girlfriend after catching her cheating. was as graceful as I could be, insisting that she stay at my apartment while I stayed with my until she finishes school early next month. we continued to have sex that day. and the night of Monday the 8th she called me asking if I could come back to the apartment and sleep with her, made sexual comments towards me,  she felt lonely( as did I) and I didnt want her to suffer, my mind made its decision but my heart lagged behind. I told her I would like to stay with my mom but I could stop by for a few hours before work in the morning to hold her, which she agreed to. I was there 5:30 the next morning, woke her up and let her know I was going to hold her, undressed and got into bed as I usually do. this lasted an hour before I needed to get ready for work. a few days ago I met with her friend who wanted to go over things with me, I told this friend what ended our relationship and I later found out that information spread around my ex''s school, causing her friends to look down on her. all her friends respected me and my commitment to her a great deal. This I''m sure created trouble for her as she will soon need a friend to move in with as she is only allowed in my apartment until school is over. two nights ago She told me she would be sleeping with someone else for the night and be away from the apartment. I decided to use the time to have some of my friends over and we had the idea to poke fun and leave a condom wrapper on the coffee table. The morning after she called furious, as expected, and i felt bad and apologied over text as this is not mature and not like me. anyway I find out later that day that in order to gain back sympathy from her friends and throw me under the bus. she started saying that I assaulted her that morning i arrived at 5:30 to hold her. She is telling people that I crawled into bed naked and does not remember making the phone call the night before, which i have record of. of course I did undress and get in bed but it was at her request and there was no force/ sign of anything wrong, and when I arrived I was invited into bed. She does not have any evidence, and again I do have record of the phone call the night before, but not what was said. there is evidence of us remaining   \n sexual towards each other at the time of the call, and cordial and on fair terms until I hurt her feelings. I feel this shows that what she is accusing me of is a reaction and not the truth. Im not sure she will actually take action on this or if its just a plan to save face. but if she does take action with it, its pretty unclear on both sides, I feel it would boil down to he said she said. I do have alot of people who would attest to my good character, i am not sure she has the same. Still I worry as I know this can get serious. What I know is that what she is telling people does not imply i did anything forcefully, which to my knowledge is required to call an action an assault. again should I be worried and where should I go from here? so far I have blocked her number and all ties and will not go near her or my apartment until I know she is out.

I‚Äôve been mulling over this for a long time and decided on anon Irish legal forum might be of use to me. \n\nBasically in the summer of 2022 I (23, F) am pretty sure I was repeatedly sexually assaulted. The reason I say pretty sure is that it was with a guy (25, M) I was casually seeing at the time and was in a low and dark place mentally and easily taken advantage of so it took a few months to connect the dots. \n\nI have since met a wonderful guy with his own history of assault and been to 6+ months of therapy where I finally opened up about it. It took a lot to finally come forward with this as I was terrified at the time and held a massive victim complex that I blamed myself for putting myself in that situation. I‚Äôve worked through a lot of my trauma but it has been a long and difficult road. My therapist actually contacted a friend of hers in the Garda√≠ as the guy himself is a secondary school teacher and she was uncomfortable with someone like that teaching underage teenagers. I‚Äôm not going to take responsibility for not reporting him as there were numerous reasons I didn‚Äôt come forward at the time. However it has been bothering me as time has gone on. My therapist recommended contacting TUSLA also but everything I‚Äôve seen online says I should contact a Rape helpline. I don‚Äôt know how comfortable I am yet discussing this topic on the phone with a stranger. \n\nI suppose I‚Äôm looking for legal advice on whether I have any legal standing on this or if it‚Äôs useless. I don‚Äôt have any hard evidence and I know this topic is very tricky and not black and white understandably. I do believe there would be CCTV footage of one of the incidents as I was nearly unconscious with drink he forced into me and it was public (this is not something I would do consensually). The fact that he‚Äôs a teacher may change this situation, honestly I‚Äôm not sure and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm coming here. If this is an inappropriate topic in this sub then I really do apologise hence why I haven‚Äôt given much detail. \n\nAnyways thanks for reading if you have and any and all advice is welcome.

Prior to this issue I had owned it for a bit over a year and it had been super reliable. Looked over by a (specialist Z car) mechanic when I got it who gave it the thumbs up aside from a few non-electrical wear and tear things that didn''t need immediate attention.\n\nOne day the car died while I was driving -- all power lost while driving at \~65mph. I pulled over and it would not start again. It cranks once and then it sounds like the starter motor continues to spin, but the engine does not continue turning over. The starter doesn''t sound like it''s struggling to drive the flywheel. The first time this happened I sat for about 20 minutes, tried it a few times during that time, and eventually it did start. Seemed to be fine for a few days. This happened again a few days later, same sequence of events. The car has mostly sat for a few months since this started happening, but I''ll get it started every now and then and run it for a bit to make sure the battery doesn''t die. \n\nI took it out again the other day and got half a mile up the road before it died again and wouldn''t start. I ended up trying to jump start it with my truck and it immediately started -- not sure if this is a coincidence or evidence of what the problem might be. I guessed maybe the battery might need replacing, and it was a few years old so I did that. No change.\n\n[Here''s a video of it failing to start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iAM8WW6W9WUsmYt2jCx4CACfZFnz0wRF/view?usp=sharing) (from today). You can hear on the last attempt at least when I release the key from the start position there is a click - not sure if that''s the relay or the solenoid snapping back.\n\n[Here is a video of me testing the starter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/170XiDJIzk0xPteYr34dwYu2ZH5G4IDVF/view?usp=sharing) after I took it off today, suspecting the starter might be partially stripped or the solenoid is busted. Seems fine to me?\n\nMy thinking:\n\n* Doesn''t struggle to turn over and starts right up when it does turn over, so unlikely to be a corrosion issue resulting in not enough current getting to the starter. Maybe this thinking is flawed.\n* Turns over once(ish) before it seems like the solenoid disengages from the flywheel. This made me suspect the solenoid or the gear on the starter motor.\n* None of this accounts for the occasional sudden losses of power while driving, so maybe it IS some other electrical issue like a faulty/loose connection, corrosion, etc.\n\nAnybody got any ideas? Thanks in advance!',2047,22,'text');

There have been ‚Äúpromises‚Äù made for months that I‚Äôd be getting a full-time offer so that‚Äôs why I stuck around that long. Back in February, my manager had mentioned to me that due to cutting down company expenses, they‚Äôd like for me to lessen my hours for the month of March. I went from 32 hours a week to about 10. \n\nFast forward to first week of April, I get another message from manager saying that my workload will be lighter than normal and giving me the heads up that they still need to wind down expenses and that my hours should still stay limited until May the longest.  \n\nI sent my recent invoice on April 15 which was the last day of that 2 week pay period. I start getting messages from coworkers asking me to upload all project files and raw videos. Basically insinuating that they have knowledge that my contract has ended‚Ä¶without me being aware. I checked my contract and it does say I need a 2 week written notice. I‚Äôve e-mailed my manager and the HR person and haven‚Äôt gotten a response in days. I mentioned to them that per my contract, that 2 week written notice is required. If they really need me to upload and hand off everything I have, I‚Äôd have to log more hours for the next pay period and then we can end my contract officially on the last day of the month. \n\nI haven‚Äôt gotten a response and I feel like their preference is to just ghost me and hopefully I don‚Äôt bother them about this again. I should be getting paid for the first 2 weeks of April but the fact they are requesting (via Slack and personal phone number might I add) for me to hand over all files without me having a clue that they‚Äôre ending my contract seems a little shady and unfair.\n\nDo I have means here to involve a lawyer? Do I ignore these messages about providing them these remaining assets? I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll say these assets and files are technically owned by the company. Just a bit confused on how to go about this. Any advice is appreciated. \n\n',1490,23,'text');

Interestingly it works best adjudted to a 40cm/16" back length.  I have hip issues and this bag seemed perfect for me for longer hiking. \n\nBut I am looking for a more sensible size commuter bag that would still fit a 16" laptop.  I''ve been loking at osprey, but local stores don''t have wide ranges... of these or alternatives tbh.

It is very elongated, given I have to set the back short... and a lot of the bag sits high, above the shoulders. \n\nAny suggestions for the 20-28l range by anyone who gets on with these bags too, or who has similar dimensions?  Wide hips too, like 43". \n\nI notice some other airspeed bags that might be a better size, but they don''t have hip pads, top bag tighteners for lighter load days, or, and this is the bit that confuses me most... they look like don''t have back length adjustment?! \n\nFor example, the hikelite 28l (bit big calacity maybe, no back length adjustment?).  \n\nI was wondering about the synchro (not short enough for me if need smaller adjustment?) or sylva... but has no back adjuster?\n\nParsec looks great except looks like it has no back length adjustment... or hip pads?  \n\nRadial is a bit big probably at 34l? And has no hip pads again (but can be adjusted for length?).  \n\nTried the non-airspeed (less structured) tempest 20 (smidgen small capacity) with the women''s small being laughable on my frame, and the medium being almost too long at minimum length... but was able to test one for a half hour walk... and am really unsure despite wanting to love it.  Had fatigue/pain with expected weight in it, and constant fiddling to try and adjust. Also the pockets etc aren''t amazing for commuter purposes, and it doesn''t have a tightening strap for the top half of the bag.\n\nAs i say, very open to other brands, but not many stores to try here, and I have establised trust for the osprey (airspeed) in my body based on sirrus 34 and a historic 70L bag I''ve had a decade or more. \n',32,26,'text');

I could use a library for this, but I really wanted to write the code myself to improve my understand of the subject, even if just a little.\n\nThe issue I''ve run into is not that the PID never reaches the proper value, but more so that it has a very odd shaping. I''m sure anyone who''s familiar with PIDs will know what they look like, but for clarity [I''m looking for shaping like the purple graph here.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359085558/figure/fig2/AS:1131718799048824@1646834196805/PID-controller-response-curves.jpg)\n\n**The hardware**\n\nI''m running the setup on an Arduino R3. The Arduino sends a digital value to a DAC (digital to analog converter). Said analog value is sent back to my Arduino.

I personally don''t think the issues are with the potmeter in particular.\n\n**The problem**\n\nMy problem is with the way my data is translated by the PID. Instead of getting the clean curvature of a normal PID, my version is rigid and doesn''t look like one at all. This will be an issue when I actually want to attach it something like a servomotor. I have obviously tried tweaking the values for Kp, Ki and Kd, but with no success. I''ve been stuck for several hours trying to debug this and Reddit is my last hope. Maybe you guys know where I''m messing up.\n\n**The code**\n\nAs I said before, all the code is being run on an Arduino R3.

My question is not about the design of the wall itself, my question is about waterproofing.  I live in the Pacific Northwest, and I don''t want water coming through the concrete.  There will be a drain pipe at the base of the wall, backfilled with 4-6" drain rock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like the traditional approach to waterproofing basement walls is some type of rubberized coating or HDPE membrane.  My question is, why not use PVC or Polycarbonate roof panels placed against the concrete instead? The part of the panels that would stick up above grade are in the shade, so no UV exposure.  In my case, there really isn''t that much area to cover and it seems like it would be easier to install and would be roughly the same price as the coatings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?',1499,29,'text');

Each feature I see on an aircraft (wingspan, airfoil shapes, number of engines, bypass ratio etc) are that way because it‚Äôs the best way in the absolute sense - a significantly better solution literally doesn‚Äôt exist.\n\nBut the more I learn the more ‚Äúband-aid‚Äù design decisions I see - those that are only made to fix/augment an earlier decision that is now too costly to change. This implies that the appearance of existing aircraft are not only driven by what‚Äôs actually optimal in the absolute sense, but the design process itself. \n\nClassic example are the ventral strakes on things like Learjets, 707s - They wouldn‚Äôt be there if they sized the vertical tail correctly upfront. The whole empennage of the Beechcraft 1900 looks like it‚Äôs only that way because the tail was originally sized for the King Air and it‚Äôs too much work to redesign. The whole 737-MAX looks like a giant band-aid solution to design decisions made in the 1960s. \n\nIf we zoom out - the peripheral infrastructure that supports the operation of aircraft were mostly designed around earlier aircraft, and newer aircraft must be designed to adapt to it. Classic example is wingspan - there‚Äôs probably huge value in designing an aircraft to have a massive wing area (lower Swet/Sref -> higher L/D at constant CL and higher cruise altitudes, also eliminates the need for flaps because landing CL would be close to cruise CL), but we can‚Äôt do that without reducing the aspect ratio - because there‚Äôs a maximum span allowable at airports - which were designed to fit existing aircraft. \n\nMy question is, when I look at a plane in an airport today, how much of what I see is truly optimal and how much of it is band-aiding?\n',2573,29,'text');

However, I''ve been advised by my study abroad consultant that thesis-based Master‚Äôs slots for international students in Canada are quite limited. Given my desire to graduate as quickly as possible, I was recommended to consider Computer Engineering instead.\n\nMy knowledge of Computer Engineering is less extensive compared to software development, but there are relatively more options available in this field, including 12 to 16-month course-based projects.

I still don''t understand basic chemistry. I wasn''t even good at math, microbiology, or chemistry in high school I just liked environmental science and thought I was smart so went for engineering. At one point I thought I finally clicked with math, but it has proven time and time again I am behind the curve with applying math concepts to design and problem solving. I can''t really think of a "strength" I have in this degree besides common sense stuff that the geniuses occasionally forget and bullshitting exceptionally well. Pretty much everyone in my classes is levels ahead of me. I rarely go to office hours or ask professors questions because often my questions don''t even make sense to them. It exposes to them and myself how much I really don''t know. Nothing comes naturally to me. Even people in my classes who bullshit constantly still know much more than I do.\n\nI have severe motivation issues, I lied to myself for 4 years and said I would have these issues no matter what path I took, even if it was a life passion and money didn''t matter, and I just have to push through it. That is probably true.

Not just the grindy work itself, but debating with myself whether I totally hate it or not.\n\nMaybe I will be proven wrong. Maybe I will find a role at a job I am decent at and won''t absolutely hate. But I doubt I will ever be completely passionate about what I am doing, since I know deep down even if I put 100% effort into it I won''t be the greatest or elite at it. If I continue as an engineer, I worry about the fact that I knew this as a young man and still chose to work in this career. Will I look back and regret the wasted years?

I have been studying integrals for the past week, but there is one question that can‚Äôt get over me. Let‚Äôs start with the fact that I perfectly understood (or so I think) the logical process that led to derivatives; and, at least in the Italian books, indefinite integrals where explained to me as the inverse of derivatives: the primitive of a function is the function that has the original function has its derivative. Now we arrive to definite integrals, I understood the entire process behind how Sn and sn with n->infinity tend to the same number, that is the area under the graph. But why exactly does this limit of a sum happen to be the same as the inverse function of the derivative? Why is the primitive of a function the function that indicates the area under the original function‚Äôs as x varies? \n\nAlso sorry if I use improper terms, i‚Äôm just translating them on the fly as there is very little information about exact math terms and their Italian translations :/ and thanks in advance :D',2016,39,'text');

I often see a lot of people implying that arlecchino crushed the dude''s skull. At first I thought that it was more likely (and realistic) that, with the noise she made, she probably kicked him away or at worst, pierced his skull with her heel. Tho seeing the way her leg moved, I was a bit more convinced she really did crush his skull, and that the noise made was just censorship.\n\nIt did got me thinking though- she must be pretty strong to be able to crush his skull, even if partially, with just one leg. That''s when I decided to do a quick search and found the results that you see on the second picture. For comparison, she is exerting the weight of a half-filled vending machine with just ONE LEG. \n\nOf course, the amount of force needed may vary depending on where you exert the pressure and the bone density, but even with that considered, that still takes quite a lot of strength to accomplish. That''s when I remembered that she literally uppercutted a fatui harbinger to the ceiling of a relatively tall building (and with terrifyingly great accuracy), to the point it SHATTERED AND COLLAPSED????? Yeah no kidding crushing the guy''s skull seems far more likely\n\nI''m also well aware that I might be looking too into this and that a great and simple explanation for all of her strength is just because it''s an anime fantasy game, but it''s pretty interesting to think about.\n\nin conclusion: arlecchino stronk. plz pull, but only if you want to',2644,43,'text');

I went with one of my buddies who always comes with me when we go camping and we went to Wales Snowdonia, we knew the weather was going to be bad, it was showing 7 degree highs and 2 degree lows with rain and 30-45 kph winds but we both have good gear (i assume from my research) and wanted to test ourselves. The first day we arrived we set up tent quite close to the car just in case something happened, around midnight, the winds began to really pick up and it started really storming, it got quiet bad at one point as i awoke to one side of my tent being blown in so hard by the wind that it was bending the pole and it somehow unzipped the zipper and a bunch of rain got into my tent at like 3am and i had to go outside freezing into storm and fix the tent, once i got in i found there was basically a puddle in the tent, i got rid of what i could and although the bottom of my mattress was wet my sleeping bag was somewhat okay so i managed to get very very broken sleep till the morning where we packed up. We was going to call the trip there but the sun came out and we parked up and went outside and i dried out all my gear that got wet and we decided to try again. However after setting up this time, at around 8pm the winds were really bad and the ground was cold and it was somehow getting through enough that my mat wasn''t keeping me warm at all and combined with the wind coming in under the tent sometimes i began to feel freezing, bare in mind this is with me wearing a wool layer, a really warm quarter zip jumper and a waterproof Patagonia coat while in a down sleeping bag, i was so cold that i told my friend who said he was surprisingly warm himself that i was too cold and we packed up and went back to the car before going back home. Maybe this is because my sleeping mat was still not fully dry or im not sure, maybe i needed to get a proper coat like something down instead of my waterproof coat. Any suggestions on what I''m doing wrong, i will list my gear below, on both those nights the temperature dropped to about 0-1 with 40kph winds.

','Here''s the jist of the LoZ lore: Three divine beings created the world and their aspects are immortalized in the triforce. Hyrule is stuck in a cycle of destruction and resurrection due to the power of these aspects, namely the Aspect of Power, which is... evil? (Nevermind how darkness has any sort of role in true unity/peace. Let''s just go with it.) \n\nEach of the three aspects follows a line of descendants (Link, Zelda, Ganon) that are fated to harness the power of the aspects when the world inevitably faces Armageddon again and again.\n\nLinks are, essentially, just stewards for the Aspect of Courage. Zeldas serve the Aspect of Wisdom. And Ganons are the chosen vessels for the Aspect of Power. And history continues to repeat itself with minor variations. (The spiritual bondage is real). \n\nNintendo needs to start treating the aspects of the triforce as separate from their chosen hosts (which is always a Link, a Zelda, and a Ganon) and create a linear storyline that follows these aspects outside and through time and space. \n\nThe Triforce represents the three beings/aspects being One, and the Aspect of Power continuously causes conflict that divides the three and literally puts the world they created in Chaos every time; there is a story there. \n\nThe LoZ team also needs to stop believing in the power of idol-worship to save Hyrule when the beings that created the world are imperfect and their greed and inadequacy is the VERY reason the world keeps trying to die in the first place. \n\nThe LoZ lore has already acknowledged that powerful beings/gods can "lose themselves" and turn into dragons. It''s already acknowledged that magical items like the Mastersword can be broken. It''s already acknowledged that Kings of Light can be defeated and overthrown by darkness. It recognizes its own flaws, but doesn''t change a thing. \n\nIt''s like beating a dead horse. \n\nIf the LoZ had any real sense, they would make the one that ultimately delivers Hyrule from its spiritual bondage a character of any race/background that doesn''t need the Aspect of Courage/ Power / Wisdom to be a legendary hero.\n ',2133,50,'text');

It was nice to be given priority to lifts, you get treated with some respect and not just thrown to the side. People didn''t really stare, other than curious kids. Bathrooms were always clean and didn''t run into the issue of having to wait to enter, able bodied people didn''t use them unlike every other country I''ve been in so far and had to wait for them to walk out. Gloves would be recommended if you''re pushing a lot, your hands get dirty pretty quick but not as bad as London streets (they make your hands really filthy). Never had an issue where lifts were broken down or out of service.\n\nWould I return? Yes, especially since there was a lot I didn''t get to see.\n\nRecommend it? If you want to go mainly for site seeing, yes. For a food experience, nope.\n\nHelpfulness? Everyone was helpful, especially when I needed help onto a train.\n\nAccessible hotels? I booked it during peak season so I had no choice but to get what I was given, I left it too long and a lot of places were fully booked. I''ll probably book Daiwa Roynet for future travels in Japan.\n\nOsaka (including Nara & Hiroshima):\n- Stayed within umeda area, it was busy every night but it wasn''t too hard to traverse and get around people.\n- Stayed at Ibis, the bathroom door was too small for my commode to pass through but room had a lot of space.\n- Couldn''t find a lot of restaurants to get into that didn''t have steps.\n\nKanazawa :\n- Nothing like Osaka with tourists or being busy. Everything was flat and easy to get around on the roads.\n- Stayed at Daiwa Roynet, by far one of the better universal rooms, spacious and easy enough to get around with a wheelchair and commode.\n- Restaurants still weren''t too accessible, there were the ones within the shopping centers which are easy enough to access due to flat entrance\n\nTokyo :\n- Busy like Osaka but still easy enough to get around, outside of peak hour. \n- Stayed at a Sotetsu hotel, bathroom was awful. For a universal room, I couldn''t reach the shower (had to have a sponge bath)and it lacked a roll in shower, plus didn''t have hot water from the hand held shower head. \n- A lot more restaurants around that had ramps for access but the doors were narrow leaving me unable to enter. Surrounding wards had pretty much the same issue but a lot of places turned away other tourists while we were allowed in (not sure if they felt sorry for me being in a chair)\n\n\n\n\n',5,55,'text');

This company says they will match her purchase as well.\n\n  \n  Where I am confused is how this turns into profit.  Does she just straight away sell the stock and then take the discount as profit?

Is my hair light enough to tone it? What toner should I even use? \n\nI have no idea what Im doing and just going off vibes lmao I dont wanna fry my hair off though obviously.

I actually got this before I went back to school to learn GR so I learned the components as best I could (using one for my Reddit username). \n\nThe lambda on the left side of the equation is the cosmological constant, which I kept there for the story (Einstein added it so his theory would fit his preconceived notion of a static universe) even though it‚Äôs generally considered to be zero, or at least was in my GR class, there‚Äôs some contention around that now. \n\nBut my favorite term is the 8piG/c^4. c^4 is a gigantic number, and 8piG is not so that term is really small. Still there‚Äôs so much stuff in space that it curves spacetime even with that. \n\nThe equation on the right (my left arm) is called the Klein-Gordon equation. It‚Äôs the Schr√∂dinger equation for relativistic particles. I got it specifically instead of the Schr√∂dinger equation because it‚Äôs the only equation I ever did some real physics with. \n\nIn quantum class you learn about infinite well potentials, which is a way of describing a particle in a container. In three dimensions this becomes an infinite spherical well. I had the thought that because of special relativity, we could consider point particles as always existing in an infinite spherical well of radius cT where T was some specific time for which this relation held. \n\nthen i took David Griffiths quantum book, and followed his steps for solving the spherical well in three dimensions but with the Klein-Gordon equation because my particles were traveling at the speed of light. \n\nif you''re in undergrad i highly recommend you try this out, its a cool result. if not here''s what i found. >!so a specific time, can be the inverse of a frequency, and c = f(wavelength) for things traveling at c, and when you substitute all of that you get wavelength = h/p, which is the deBroglie wavelength!<. no doubt someone with more cred than me will read this and tell me im wrong, but it was a surprising result i got to on my own, which was cool enough to get a tattoo about. \n\nAll of this is to say, tattoos are cool, and Physics is cool, and if you''re gonna mix the two, get excited when internet strangers want to know more.

INSERT INTO posts(title,content,creator_id,community_id,post_type) VALUES ('All forces in nature due to curvature of underlying fields/space','So, we know from GR that the relativistic theory of gravity that should obey special relativity is a theory of curved space-time. The mathematics that comes into play is differential geometry. In extrinsic way, we can embed a curved space into a higher dimensional flat space, define a position vector from the arbitrary origin to any point on the surface and then differentiate with respect to the different cartesian coordinates. The curvature of space implies coupling of coordinates. \n\nExample: a curved 2D-space can be embedded in flat 3D space where the position vector will have components x1, x2, x3 ( x1, x2). We can differentiate with respect to x1, x2 and obtain tangent vectors. From there we can define new mathematical entities and then differentiate again to get yet more mathematical entities. This cycle repeats as many times as needed to model a given physical phenomenon. This way we define tangent vectors, reciprocal tangent vectors (co-vectors), co- and contra-variant metric tensors, normal vectors, Christoffel-symbols (connection-coefficients), covariant-derivative, Riemann-curvature tensor, Ricci tensor and scalar etc. \n\nThe metric tensor is the object we seek to obtain by solving the Einstein-equation which equates the Einstein tensor + cosmological constant term with the energy-momentum tensor which is just the 4-flux of each component of 4-momentum. The metric tensor then allows us to solve for the length of an arc and to solve the geodesic equation. \n\nUnfortunately, the effects of GR and thus curvature of space-time is only noticeable for huge amounts of energy and matter; therefore we only perceive them on a macroscopic scale. Unlike the other 3 (?) known forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong), GR is not a quantum theory and is thus incompatible with the quantum field theoretical descriptions of the other forces as excitations of bosonic fields interacting with fermionic fields through a coupling. All these bosonic fields are special vector fields, namely gauge fields which are themselves connection fields. \n\nThe idea of a connection is that we want to compare neighboring physical objects corresponding to different space-time points / events. However, the difference may be due to a change of basis vectors/reference frame etc. so just differentiating would be nonsensical. \nExample: Imagine a homogeneous vector fields on 2D flat surface with covariant basis vectors on the polar coordinate lines. These basis vectors will obviously point in different directions as we move through space. The same invariant vector can in general have different components on different space-time points despite the field being homogeneous. Just differentiating the components alone is therefore nonsensical as one will conclude that the vector field is not homogeneous due to changing components. To account for the change of reference frame (different basis vectors here), we introduce the covariant derivative which essentially yields the additional Chriftoffel-term we get for free when considering product rule for differentiation on our vector fields. \n\nThe Christoffel-symbols alone do not imply any curvature themselves but the commutator of covariant derivatives acting on a vector is in general non-zero and the result is what is known as the Riemann curvature tensor which is THE object for measuring curvature. We can understand this by considering the "parallel transport" of a vector around a loop. The following is no rigorous proof but if your space is flat then you can always switch to cartesian coordinates and the induced vector basis is orthonormal and constant, the metric tensor is simply the Kronecker-delta (the identity matrix). Thus, the Riemann-Christoffel-tensor will be zero as it contains derivatives of Christoffel symbols and just Christoffel symbols which themselves are all functions of derivatives of the metric. Since zero times the Jacobi-tranformation term yields zero again, we conclude that the space is flat. Likewise, if the Riemann-tensor is non-zero, we cannot transform to cartesian coordinates, hence space must be curved. \n\nNow let''s turn to QFT where we have Lagrangian-densities to understand the EOM''s for our fields. One of the most important Lagrangian is the Dirac-Langrangian which describes the behavior of spin1/2 spinor fields. All three generations of quarks and leptons are described by spinors. We look for symmetries in our Lagrangian and we find that there is a U1 symmetry (complex phase in form of e^i"theta") That is a global symmetry. In order to promote it to a local symmetry, the theta must be dependent on the coordinates. We find that the LG (Lagrangian) is not invariant under said transformation. We introduce something we also call covariant derivative that transforms just like the field does. We have to introduce an additional field which turns out to be a connection field A whose transformation is prescribed to fit the above condition. Having introduced a new field, we need an equation of motion for it. We need a quadratic kinetic term to add to our Lagrangian which are terms including the Faraday-tensors/field tensors of EM, essentially the Maxwell-Lagrangian or Proca-Lagrangian for m=0. Now, it turns out that we can express the field tensor in terms of the commutator of these covariant derivatives which make it formally look similar to how the commutator of covariant derives in GR give rise to Riemann curvature tensor. As such, people started giving them the term of curvature as well. So the EM Faraday-tensor is a curvature tensor. Similarly, for Su2 (weak) and Su3 (strong), we find field tensors which can be interpreted as curvature as well. \n\nThus, all forces except the Higgs field (not sure whether you consider it a force or not since it is technically a bosonic field) can be perceived as some sort of curvature in an underlying abstract mathemathical spaces. \nHowever, unlike space-time whose curvature can be understood visually from an extrinsic point of view, I''ve never seen any visualizations of the "gauge" curvatures. I''m not even sure what exactly is curved. The people I''ve asked talked about the principle U1 bundle etc. What I am looking for is a concise and simple geometrical visualization of what is curved and how it is curved. Curvature is by nature a very visual concept and see hundreds of such visualization when you google GR but the same cannot be said for gauge fields‚Ä¶ Why is that? Please enlighten me or provide a good reference. \n\n',1230,62,'text');

I''ve been a fan of the Animorphs since the beginning, and now I''ve written a fan remake of the series.\n\nFor those who aren''t familiar with the series.  It''s a series of late 90s/early 00s YA science fiction books that focuses on an ensemble cast of preteens who are thrust into an interstellar war that''s found it''s way to earth.  The "bad guys" are a race of parasitic slugs who take over the bodies of other species.  They have established a central body of government on earth in an attempt to infest the entirety of the human race, and the kids are fighting them with espionage and subterfuge.  Their only weapons are anonymity and the ability to morph into animals thanks to an alien technology.\n\nThe debate: In my remake, I set the story in more modern times.  This is seen by many as a mistake because the boom of cameras and security systems would make the secrecy impossible.  Some argue the antagonist couldn''t hide their evil plans, some argue that the kids couldn''t hide their identities and morning ability.\n\nMy points: The aliens are a nonstarter argument.  Any race capable of traversing the galaxy would have no problem overcoming modern security.\n\nThe kids would also get around it because of the following reasons.\n1. One of the primary issues in the books is the need to "find a safe place to morph".  Often times leading them to resort to morphing in the forest, one of the characters barn, dark alleys, etc.  Essentially, no where cameras would be today either.\n\n2.

INSERT INTO posts(title,content,creator_id,community_id,post_type) VALUES ('The Great Gatsby (book) theory - Daisy knew exactly what she was doing the whole time','\nI bet I am not the only person to think of this, but I haven‚Äôt seen this theory on here. I just finished reading The Great Gatsby for English class, and it occurred to me - what if Daisy wasn‚Äôt as innocent and foolish as she seemed? My theory is that, not only did Daisy kill Myrtle on purpose, but also that she was using Gatsby to improve her relationship with Tom.\n\nWhen we first met Daisy, she seemed depressed because of her failing marriage. Tom is cheating and ignoring her. I believe that Daisy loved Tom a lot more than she let on, hence why she was so upset. She stays with him, even while knowing about Myrtle (it explicitly states that Daisy knew that Tom was having an affair, but does not clarify if she knew who the mistress was. I believe she did. Tom was obviously not quiet about it (introducing Myrtle as ‚Äòhis girl‚Äô), so it makes sense it would get back to Daisy eventually). Tom took Daisy for granted, believing that she would never leave him. So since Daisy really loved Tom, she wanted to get rid of his affair partner, and make sure he appreciated her.\n\nIn this theory, at the time the book is set, Daisy did not love Gatsby. She did once, but she had long since moved on. When she heard about Gatsby (from Jordan at dinner), she was surprised that he had made so much of himself, but still felt nothing but indifference towards him. But when Nick sets up a meeting, she realises she has an opportunity to get her husband''s attention. Just like that saying; you don‚Äôt appreciate things until they are gone. Daisy believed that if she made it seem like she was in love with someone else, her husband would treat her better, to stop her from leaving him. This explains why Daisy continually seemed to meet with both of them, instead of keeping them apart like a person having an affair would usually do. Daisy never wanted to keep Gatsby a secret. And it works. Tom starts to panic; ‚ÄúHis wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control.‚Äù\n\nDaisy does not even try to hide her affair. Just by watching the two together, Tom figures it out and is furious. Gatsby tries to get Daisy to admit that she never loved her husband, and while she obliges at first, she takes it back quickly. Because she does love her husband and doesn‚Äôt want to actually lose him. She said that she used to love him, but did not anymore, implying that since he started treating her badly, she stopped loving him. It seems like Daisy is trying to show her husband what happened when he treated her badly, and that she could betray him just as easily as he betrayed her. \n\nFinally, Daisy leaves with Gatsby, and Tom is devastated. In this trip, Daisy ties up the final loose end and hits Myrtle (Tom‚Äôs mistress) with a car. Of course, there was no way this could have been planned earlier. Daisy had no idea Myrtle would be at the front of the house. But when she saw the opportunity, she took it. As Gatsby says ‚ÄúWell, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.‚Äù Daisy steered the car away until she saw who it was. Myrtle was her husband''s weakness and Daisy must have been worried that even with her ploy with Gatsby, Tom would choose Myrtle over her. She did not know that Myrtle was planning to move away and that Tom‚Äôs affair would be ended anyway. Only Tom, Nick and Jordan were present for that conversation.\n\nThe moment Myrtle jumps in front of the car, Daisy realised this was her chance. The car wasn‚Äôt hers and couldn‚Äôt be traced back to her. Gatsby loved her so much that he would do anything for her, including taking the fall for manslaughter. And so she ploughs into Myrtle and doesn‚Äôt even stop driving. Gatsby tries to stop her, but she refused. Then she allows Gatsby to believe it was an accident and take the fall. \n\nAfterwards, she demands Gatsby drive her back to her husband''s house. Since she has no further use for him, she coldly dismisses Gatsby. Her mission is complete. Tom and her reunite. He now has a newfound appreciation of her, knowing that she would be willing and able to leave him. He also no longer has his mistress holding him back. They move away together and Daisy does not look back.\n\nI don‚Äôt think that Gatsby‚Äôs death was part of Daisy‚Äôs plan. I believe that she had no idea that Tom told Mr Wilson who the yellow car belonged to. However, she didn‚Äôt seem to care at all when he died, since she didn‚Äôt really love him. After all, Gatsby was just a means to an end, as was Myrtle''s death.',2043,75,'text');

I don''t care about HP spoilers. >![Snape kills Dumbledore!](https://youtu.be/PcGFVcb500Q?si=3xsIX2BwfE6gJ1hb&t=89)!<\n\nBasically title, Frieren is training a magical orphan child soldier in hyper specific magic to beat her enemies.\n\nBoth Dumbledore and Frieren are hyper-powerful mages, replete with destructive power well beyond the realm of normal or even highly skilled magic duelists. To delve a bit more into Frieren, I take her motivation to remember Himmel is tied up with a desire to understand her (now legendary and ancient) master Flamme.  >!In my read of the situation Flamme is the foil to Serie, as her legacy is one which has built the human empire, both with her protective magics and through the formalization of magical knowledge. Flamme also has one notable student, Frieren, where Serie freely admits that her many apprentices have failed to live up to their potentials.!<\n\nSo, after concealing her magic >!and building up mana for 1000 years!< Frieren and her party kill the Demon King. Now her vocation is teaching a powerful magic orphan, and apparently catching up on how humans work. Just like Dumbledore leads the resistance against a dark lord, gets the three magic items of Death himself, and trains up a magic orphan to actually defeat his enemy.\n\nOne should also compare Harry and Fern. First, they are both orphans and killed something really powerful as small children. They both have guardians who started their journey. Narratively with Dumbledore and Frieren. But also through the blood protection magic granted by an annual stay at the Dursley residence and Heiter with Fern''s magical staff and tricking Frieren into taking an apprentice. \n\nOur magical child-soldiers also have another strange commonality, a hyper specialization into an offensive spell; for Harry ''expelliarmus,'' the disarming charm and for Fern ''zoltraak,'' the demon killing magic. Other magic users have a broad armamentarium of varied, powerful, flashy, and destructive magics. Harry and Fern have taking a the note from their master''s knowledge of magical knife fighting and the wisdom of Bruce Lee: ‚ÄúI fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.‚Äù Both of these spells are interesting in they have a pure focus on ending a battle via disarmament or death respectively. No reliance on natural materials, physical damage, area of effect, or unneeded photons for flashy effects. Also, they can apparently be cast very rapidly, and do not require (in DnD terms) concentration or multiple rounds to work. A bloody-minded meta game of the magical system and a focus on fast, direct attacks on a presumably superior opponent.\n\nSpeaking of meta gaming, one should also note the similarity between Harry and Fern using magical concealment extensively. For Harry this is Death''s own invisibility cloak given to him by Dumbledore. Fern specializes in concealing her magic trained by Frieren; being able to backstab demons or mages who misjudge or entirely fail to sense her mana. Sneaking around, gathering intel, planning, and getting proximity to powerful threats allows our protagonists to avoid fights they''d lose, namely knock-down fights of magical showmanship with powerful destructive spells. This is spycraft versus boxing, there is no glory in fighting fair or standing upright against 10 rounds of punches - win or die. Those masters of the old arts are there to slug it out by animating statues, summoning black holes, shooting beams of pure destructive power, and mastering wordless magic. Their chosen prot√©g√©s will magically kick you in the balls without warning. \n\nTLDR; Fern and Harry are both magical child soldiers, trained by truly peak magic users in a long game to beat their enemies via a bloody-minded understanding of magical conflict.',963,75,'text');

Ok that can be bad but he is a decent looking guy with magic, Intelligence and he is a king. But you have to see things from his point of view. From him talking about the tapestry it leads you to believe he was in a kingdom that fell/destroyed so he wished upon a star and got magic powers to create and protect a new kindom to give everone a happy life. So with that he needed a way to not only protect Rosas from not only exterior threats but from those within (a traiter or rebelion could have destroyed his old kingdom). When the citizens turn 18 they give there wish to him and he grants some of them. The ones he grants are deemed  helpful to the kingdoms growth and prostperity. But for the ones that he doesnt grant are regarded as a threat to the preasent or future of the kindom(main charecters grandpa, due to the generic wish for inspiring the next generation could lead to rebelion). With that in mind Asha only wants to work for the king because whoever works for him gets what they ask for, and what she wants is for him to grant Sabinos and Sakinas wishes. Then when King Magnifico explains to her Sabinos wish is to dangerous to grant, Asha tells them that his wish wont be granted. She decided to wish on the stars to get there wishes granted and the star appears starting off the problem. The king was terified that there is a new magic in his kingdom and can destroy everything he built. He wanted to go straight to the dark magic to find the magic and stop it but his wife said to trust his people and he did. What did he get in return, her friend questioned him in the dumbest way to stall for time and got other citizens to question him. Due to that he was forced to use dark magic to find the new magic. By using the dark magic it corrupted him with more power then he ever had turning him into an evil version of himself. Events of the movie eventualy leads him to be sealed in his staff and the town RETURNS to a happy kingdom.\n\nSo to sum up the movie it is about a 17 year old girl who is selfish, tries to get a job just so she can get what she wants. When she doesnt get what she wants she breaks and enters then steals what she wants and in doing so her and her friends actions corrupt the man they victimized because she is to young to understand what the king explained to her.\n\nWhat did the king who created a peaceful land, no taxes, and a chanse to get a wish grantes get. Betrayed by his people, betrayed by his wife and sealed in a staff. All so a selfish child gets everything she wants.\n\nGlad to see a disney''s movie change thier formula.\n\n',2656,75,'text');

So, we aren''t talking about the novels or the sequels. The theory might still work with the other ones included, but I''m setting them aside. Also, I''ll use "velociraptor" and "raptor" interchangeably. Yes, the Jurassic Park raptors are not true velociraptors, not even true dinosaurs due to the frog DNA parts. But, whatever they are, let''s just call them "raptors."\n\n**In the 1993 Jurassic Park movie, the raptors, given what they knew, were entirely justified in doing what they did.** If you put humans in the situation the raptors were in then the humans would more or less do the same things. Misguided? Sure, perhaps, but desperate times call for desperate measures, and without any schooling the distinction between adult and juvenile individuals might not mean much. Jurassic Park is like the movie "The Great Escape," but from the human/Nazi perspective.\n\nSide note: Including The Lost World ret-con, where they grew up wild and then captured, doesn''t change much. Maybe they had more "culture," but they would also have a taste of freedom, which could motivate them to escape that much more. In the The Lost World version, the raptors in the first movie are as if you were kidnapped from your family at about the age of 12, and then (seemingly) doomed to spend the rest of your life in prison.\n\nLet''s think about the situation the raptors were born into:\n\n- born into a world without parents; no one around to teach you how things work, morality, language, etc. The raptors were like feral children, or children raised in confinement, who then became adults: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child#Raised_in_confinement\n\n- confined to an enclosure ridiculously and inhumanely small. Think orcas at Sea World: these are animals who really need a lot of room to live "happy" lives.\n\n- At best, uncaring and/or indifferent captors. Physical abuse, cattle prods in the opening scene, is inflicted on them. These captors control how much food you get too, so while it wasn''t confirmed, it stands to reason that withholding food would have been used as a behavior modification technique. **Robert Muldoon is essentially an abusive parent.**\n\n- **you aren''t able to talk to your captors.** In that little pit, it doesn''t look like those raptors are getting much socialization with their human captors. Could the raptors have learned to understand English and teach humans to understand "raptor language"? It isn''t clear, but we do know that they have some way of communicating with each other. **Regardless, it''s fairly obvious that no one tried to talk to them.** Maybe the raptors learned the meaning of a few English/Spanish words by hearing the humans talk when around the raptors. It would depend on enough people talking around them, and saying the right things, for the raptors to suss out the meaning.  By "raptor language" I mean, assuming the raptors don''t have the physiology to make human-like sounds, they could invent some kind of ad hoc language in a format that the raptors can do physiologically, and humans can understand. For example, humans could speak English to the raptors, and the raptors could "speak" to the humans using sign language. **Even if it was theoretically possible for humans and raptor to "talk" to each other, for whatever reason, that didn''t happen.**\n\n**The velociraptors have zero control over their lives, and that alone is enough to drive a person/raptor crazy.** Lack of control is very distressing. Even if the humans were open to trying to make the raptors'' lives better, which they probably weren''t willing to do, the raptors had no way of communicating their complaints to the humans. **It''s like being in jail in a foreign country.** On top of that, their living situation is unpleasant in a lot of ways, so it is completely understandable for them to try to escape, "by any means necessary," if that''s what it comes to.\n\nWith that context in mind, the behavior of the raptor, both on and off screen, makes a lot of sense.\n\n- The "alpha" raptor needed to become "raptor Mussolini" before it could start making serious attempts to escape, so that is why it killed all the others except two. They systematically tested the electric fences. Obviously, doing that is going to suck, so the other raptors might not want to do it, so the others might try "raptor pack coup d''√©tat," so the first order of business is to become a dictator. Leaving any more than two other individuals alive (presumably) would make it possible for the three of them to over power the leader. Maybe "raptor Mussolini" only cared about its self, or maybe it saw the murder of its sisters as a regrettable-yet-necessary step to free raptor kind.\n\n- Having established control over the group, "raptor Mussolini" can start executing the escape plan. To that end, the leader ordered the others to test the electrical fences. There may have been other tests, but by the time of the events of the movie, they hadn''t found another way out. So, the raptors were at the point where they kind of have to wait for an opportunity when the electric fences are turned off. \n\n- Did they figure out that the power was down? Or, were they regularly testing the fences every day, and that''s how they figured out the fences were down? It isn''t clear. Regardless, they noticed and then took advantage of the opportunity.\n\n- From the perspective of the raptors, all humans are evil, so once they were able to get out their next priority was to find and exterminate all humans in the area. Without knowing they''re on an island, or knowing anything about the outside world, securing the immediate area is a reasonable thing to do. Arguably, making a run for it would also be a reasonable option, but without any understanding of the world outside their cage, spending at least the initial hours/days to kill as many humans as possible makes a good deal of sense. If they had been successful, then maybe after day two they''d be like "okay, I think we got all of them in the immediate area, so now let''s make a run for it!"\n\n- By going on the attack, the raptors are able to have the fight at the time and place of their choosing, rather than letting the humans choose a situation where the humans have the advantage. We see this in the movie: the whole thing with them luring Muldoon into the jungle and then killing him once he is isolated. As far as the raptors know, the humans in the park are all the humans in existence, so wiping them out ASAP is a decent strategy.\n\n- Believing that the raptors understood the strategic importance of the maintenance shed is probably giving them too much credit. More plausible, they picked up the smell of Arnold, and having noticed that he appeared to be on his own, the one raptor was sent to kill him while the other two stayed together. Presumably, the plan would be to meet up later.\n\n- The raptors trying to kill Tim and Lex is the most questionable choice, but there are a few options here. Maybe the raptors saw no difference between adult and child humans. Maybe the raptors were able to make that distinction but still felt justified in killing the children too. Maybe letting the children go would risk them telling the adults where the raptors were, so the children had to be silenced. Maybe they were (understandably?) hell bent on revenge. Maybe they knew that injuring the children would draw the adults to the children, using them as bait so as to ambush and kill the adults. Maybe the children were a convenient snack; to the raptors, maybe they saw the human children the same way humans see a lamb.\n\n- Innocent people are killed in war all the time. Even the "good guys" in a war kill innocent people. That is assuming the raptors saw humans as "sentient beings," which they might not have seen them as. To the raptors, humans could have been seen as relatively intelligence animals who''s lives are still worth less than the self described "sentient" raptors.\n\n- Like, is it okay to kill baby mice when they are a pest? Most people wouldn''t see the fact that they''re baby mice rather than full grown adult mice as a significant difference. They''re all pests that need to be exterminated, from the perspective of the human farmer. \n\n- The raptors never get ahold of Tim and Lex, so we can''t be certain that the raptors were trying to kill them. I mean, technically. Maybe the raptors just wanted to take them prisoner. Maybe the raptors were just curious; just wanted to hold them down, smell them, look at them a bit, and let them go. Like catch and release fishing, if you will.\n\n- The one raptor abandoning her battle buddy in the walk in freezer was questionable, though not much time had passed, and we don''t see what it did off screen. Maybe it tried to open the freezer door but couldn''t figure it out. Maybe it was like "hang in there buddy, I''m coning back, we just need need to kill the other humans here, and I''ll find our partner to also come and help."\n\n- the raptor that got bitten by the t. rex: that is why situational awareness is so important, and given how few escape attempts they''ve made - maybe this is their first one - making mistakes would be expected. The raptors wouldn''t have known about any of the other dinosaurs unless and until they happened to run into one of them. The raptors didn''t know that the t. rex was a thing. Hyper focus on your target is a very common mistake, and in lots of situations, hyper focus is advantageous. In that situation though, the raptor made a serious mistake and paid the price for it.\n\n- the raptor attacking the t. rex after the other one was bitten by it: was she trying to avenge her friend? Trying to help/avenge your friends even though the odds are stacked against you has a certain amount of honor, heroisms about it. In that moment the t. rex became the much more serious threat than the humans. Attacking the t. rex then was possibly the best chance the raptor had to beat it. Maybe the raptor had a good chance of killing the t. rex, but that particular fight didn''t go well. In hindsight, running away would have been the better choice. The raptor that attacked the t. rex might not have know about her buddy in the freezer. It isn''t clear which was which, or if the two remaining raptors had a chance to talk. If she had know about her buddy, she might have nope out of there to go free her friend and *then* get back to business. \n\n**tl;dr: the raptors were like abandoned, traumatized children who grew into adults, who have spent most of their lives in a prison run by cruel, sadistic creatures. In such a dire situation you''d do almost anything to try to escape; escape or die trying. Through no fault of their own, the raptors had no way to talk to humans, so they never had a chance to work things out diplomatically. Given the way they were treated, the raptors were justified in trying to kill every human they came across.**',677,75,'text');

Mike tells Vanessa when she visits his house that his mom died and his dad broke down shortly after, which is why he''s caring for Abby. Thing is, he never specifies how she died.

Why do I say this? Because of a few hints:\n\n1. *Lila''s connection to the Cult*\n\nWe know for a fact at this point that Skid''s dad was part of the Cult, maybe even its leader. We also know that Lila is most likely aware of this, since there''s a cultist robe in the attic of Skid''s house, meaning she is also aware of the fact the Cult exists. Considering the paranormal shenanigans happening around her and her family, it''s very likely she will try to find out if the cultists are behind it all, as while she isn''t a detective, she can be a very determined person when she wants to.\n\n2. *Her inner demons*\n\nPartially ties back to my previous point. Until now, Lila has avoided anything that reminds her of the dark parts of her past. But considering she might go after the cultists, it means she will innevitably have to deal with painful memories, something that appears to be very in tone with episodes like Hollow Sorrows. Also, considering the story potential for such a plot, I find it very likely for the show to go in this direction.\n\n3. *Skid and Pump need guidance*\n\nWith the Cult and Eyes growing stronger every day, it''s clealy time for S&P to understand a bit more about the situation, as well as start growing up. This seems like a perfect role for Lila, as she can act as both a moral compass for the children, as well as a guide to the supernatural (to some degree).

So for you which version outweighs?

My reasoning is because years ago I had a friend who just cut me off and started ignoring me when I needed them most. My grandmother had just died and I was grieving but apparently to her I was "no longer fun to be around" and "being my friend was just too hard at the moment" and that made my pain so much worse. After a while she came back and started acting like nothing had happened but in the back of my mind I couldn''t stop thinking about if things get hard again is she going to leave again? So I ended the friendship and honestly it was a relief. I know this isn''t exactly what Ron did to Harry but he did abandon him in a time where he really did need friends to rely on and to me that''s not the kind of friend I want to have.\n\nSo what are your thoughts?',1297,78,'text');

Is Hogwarts Truly the Safest Place on Earth?','I just finished book number two, so whatever I‚Äôm saying here is based on books one and two. If you want to engage in a debate, base yourself on these 2 books without giving spoilers about the others. There''s something that confuses me: People keep saying that Hogwarts is the safest place on earth and Dumbledore is the greatest wizard, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me reading books number one and two. For example, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it blows my mind that Dumbledore was not able to solve the mystery behind the Chamber of Secrets, knowing that Tom Riddle opened that chamber 50 years before when Dumbledore was still a teacher, so he had 50 years to solve that mystery that Harry Potter and his two friends, who are only 12 years old at the time, were able to solve in just one school year. Also, how can people say that Hogwarts is the safest place on earth when students were being petrified here and there, and Dumbledore was able to do nothing to stop it? If it wasn‚Äôt for Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Ginnie Weasley would‚Äôve been dead. And maybe many other students. I don‚Äôt know if you guys understand what I want to say, but they were able to solve a mystery in just one school year when Dumbledore knew about that chamber of secrets for 50 years. Harry had to face the ghost of Riddle alone, only 12 years old and knowing about magic for just one year. Also, the same for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer''s Stone because how could Dumbledore, being the smarter greatest wizard of all time, have let a bad professor come into his school for the whole school year, plotting with Voldemort without him noticing? It was Harry, being 11 years old at the time, who had to go and confront him. It just blows my mind that a child has to do that. And talking about professors, can we talk about Gilderoy Lockhart? How could Dumbledore be fooled by such a crook? I mean, I don‚Äôt know, man. I think it doesn‚Äôt add up, and I‚Äôm willing to get into a deep discussion about that.',2353,78,'text');
